            <p>Hello! My Name is Haley Bridges and i'm 21. A few things about me is I love to puzzle, journal, craft, sleep, and play with my cat Millie! A really interesting fun fact about myself is that I was in a Chick-Fil-A commerical when I was 17!! It was a super cool experience overall:)</p>
            <p>I only like a few movies, to be completely honest, I can hardly get through a full movie without falling asleep. A few I do manage to get through/like is 'The Great Gatsby', 'The Substance', and 'Leave The World Behind'.</p>
